    <h1> <center>Editorial Guidelines</center></h1>

<p>IssueWire's editorial team reviews all press releases before it is distributed to ensure that the content is newsworthy and accurate in a PR format. The guidelines that are written below help your PR get quick approval and distribution in our platform. The press releases should have a clear and newsworthy angle and be free from spam, direct address and ads hype. It should incorporate the following features:</p>

PR Content:
The news angles that have timely information about an organizational milestone like an award or anniversary, pro tip on a topic in the news, business expansion or recent event, new service, or products. The news announcement must be mentioned in the headline as not everything is newsworthy. Don't try to qualify your press release for ads or post a general interest article or content that lacks news value.

Tone:
Always write in the third person - don't put “WE” or “I” unless you are using a direct quote. Consider the perspective of the reader and write to the point while being engaging. Avoid adjectives and sales-pitch language. Don't put your own opinions while writing. Try to avoid jargon as not many understand it. Last but not the least, always proofread to avoid expensive errors.

Accuracy:
For all press releases referencing to criminal matters or legal actions, IssueWire will need complaint number, the court of record and case number.

Information:
Press Releases submitted to IssueWire should contain a valid email address and phone number in the contact information.
